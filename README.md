## How to Run

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Click the badge at the top of this README or [open this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jorgejrolo/HCU-Risk-Audit-Screaming-Frog-Python/blob/main/hcu_risk_audit_screamingfrog.ipynb)
2. Upload your Screaming Frog export (CSV or XLSX).
3. Run all cells and review the generated outputs.

### Option 2: Local Python Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorgejrolo/HCU-Risk-Audit-Screaming-Frog-Python.git
cd HCU-Risk-Audit-Screaming-Frog-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook hcu_risk_audit_screamingfrog.ipynb
Example Output
Address	HCU_Risk	Word Count	Inlinks	H1	H2	Notes
https://example.com/page-1	92	120	1	Yes	No	Thin + orphan + no structure
https://example.com/page-2	65	800	5	Yes	Yes	Solid but meta description missing

Notes
HCU Risk is a relative metric: higher scores = higher priority for review.

The script does not make changes to your site ‚Äî it only analyzes and prioritizes.

You can tweak the scoring formula inside the notebook to fit your specific SEO context.
